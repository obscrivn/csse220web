        The same quiz question can appear in multiple quizzes. When a teacher updates the actual query made by a quiz question,
        the update should be reflected in all quizzes that utilize that question. A student takes a quiz by providing a quiz ID

          <h2>Design Problem 2 - Vapor Sales</h2>
          <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

          <p>Vapor, the popular video game digital store, has hired you as a consultant to design a 
            sales management application. Each game available to purchase through Vapor has a title, 
            ESRB rating (e.g., "T" for "Teen"), and price, all of which are fixed. 
            You may assume game titles are unique.</p>

    <p>Vapor also sells game bundles, which complicates their sales records (hence why they hired 
      you instead of designing the application themselves). 
      Each bundle is a set of games with a clever name (e.g., "Boom Bundle 2") and price (less than the sum of the individual game prices) 
      determined in advance by the marketing team. Every bundle contains at least two games, 
      and a game may appear in more than one bundle. You may assume bundle names are unique.</p>
    
   <p>For any given bundle, Vapor wants to be able to generate a report including 
    the bundle's name, price, included game titles, how many times 
    the bundle was purchased, and the total revenue from that bundle.</p> 
    
    <p>Also, Vapor wants to be able to produce a sales report for each game, 
      including how many times the game has been sold individually or as part of a bundle 
      (e.g., "TeamCastle has sold 27 copies individually and 44 copies as part of a bundle").</p>
    
    <p>The game's sales report should also include the total revenue from that game. 
      For computing total revenue, Vapor distributes the sales price of 
      each bundle evenly across all games in the bundle. 
      For example, a bundle of four games sold for $60 should count as $15 of revenue for each game.</p>
    
   <p>Finally, Vapor wants a method to determine the game with 
    the highest total revenue and a method to determine the most popular (i.e., most copies sold) bundle.</p>

    <h2>CSSE 220: Design Problem 3 - Spaceships</h2>
    <p>
      In a single-player spaceship racing game, the mechanics surrounding ships are particularly important.
      Each ship has its own current position, rotation, and velocity. The game consists of a single-player ship,
      controlled by the player, and several "enemy" ships controlled by AI. Rotation and velocity can be increased or
      decreased to steer any ship.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Enemy Ships:</strong> AI-controlled ships are steered using a single AI strategy that depends on a <em>flying strategy</em>.
        This strategy (which could be different for each enemy ship) sets the rotation and velocity at regular intervals (e.g., every 10ms).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Player Ship:</strong> The ship controlled by the player gets its rotation and velocity input from the player’s controller.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are two commands to consider:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <code>updatePlayerInput(inputData)</code>: Called when a player presses a key on the controller.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>moveAllShips()</code>: First asks the enemy/AI ships to update their rotation and velocity, then updates the position of <em>all</em> ships in the game based on their current settings.
      </li>
    </ol>

    At a particular company, departments are composed of named teams and each team has a yearly budget. Teams have both employees and equipment, each of which have a calculated yearly cost. Employees consist of a position and a start date, and their cost is calculated based on their position and how long they have been in the company. Equipment consists of dimensions (length, width and height) and weight, which are used to calculate the cost of the equipment due to storage. A team is over budget if the total yearly cost of all employees and equipment is greater than the team's budget. It should be possible to print a list of all teams within a department that are over budget.

      <h2>CSSE 220: Design Problem 5 – Tag</h2>
      <p>
        We are designing a portion of a multiplayer tag game with some interesting features.
        There are characters and each character is designated a rendering color (blue, red, etc.) and a name.
        Characters may collide with circuit boards that may be collected (max of 4) and each circuit board has an ID
        and a total number of ports (ports are used to store power‑ups) on each board.
        Circuit boards carry power‑ups, one per port. Characters can also collide with power‑ups on the playing surface,
        and if there is an open port on any circuit board, the power‑up can be attached to a board.
        Once the ports are filled, no more power‑ups may be added nor any discarded. When characters collide,
        their power‑up combinations determine who “tagged” whom. For simplicity, think of a complex
        “Paper, Rock, Scissors” type set of rules (or “Paper, Rock, Scissors, Lizard, Spock” if you’re a
        Big Bang Theory fan) for all the power‑ups — each power‑up, or set therein, can beat some and lose to others.
        The set of rules for the power‑ups are an implementation detail that is not important to our design,
        we simply need the names of the power‑ups of each character to determine which character “won” the tag.
        Also, for simplicity, assume we only need to track the characters, circuit boards and power‑ups
        (each with pertinent data); we will not worry about the rendering/drawing parts of the design
        or the playing surface (which could be 2D or 3D) or even the movement of the characters.
        When characters collide, the winner name should be printed along with all the names of the winner's power‑ups.

      <h2>CSSE 220: Design Problem 6 – Inventory</h2>
      <p>
        EIT needs to keep inventory of the laptops from various professors that are currently being serviced by EIT.
        It is important for EIT to know the current OS version installed so that it can be updated while being serviced,
        if necessary. Also, EIT must track the laptop's owner. Each device comes with an extra as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>SurfaceBook owners get a pen, for which we track the pen's model number.</li>
        <li>MacBook owners get a trackpad and the condition of the trackpad should be tracked.</li>
        <li>ChromeBook owners get an unlimited number of speakers to use with the Chromebook and the number must be tracked.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At the end of each workday the manager of EIT wants two different reports generated:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A <em>service ticket report</em> that lists each laptop being serviced and includes:
          the laptop type (e.g., MacBook, Surface, etc.), its OS version, and its owner.
        </li>
        <li>
          A <em>laptop owner report</em> that just lists all the owners of laptops currently being serviced by EIT
          with their respective extra device information.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Turn-In Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        You will complete these design problems via GradeScope, which is linked from Moodle.
      </p>
      <h2>Grading</h2>
      <h3>Assignment Parts and Points</h3>
      <p>
        Details on the specific parts and point values are provided in GradeScope.
      </p>
      <h3>Defective Solutions and Your Response</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When identifying the problems in a defective solution, you must clearly explain why a design principle is violated.
        </li>
        <li>
          You should identify the main flaw in each defective design. While multiple flaws may exist, there is usually one primary issue.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your final solution must address the issues you have identified and propose a design that is better than the problematic solutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          To earn full credit, your design must improve <strong>at least</strong> one of the two bad solutions.
        </li>
      </ul>
