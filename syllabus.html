    <div class="content-section">
      <h2>Optional Textbook</h2>
      <p>
        This book is especially good for students who would like some help with Java, as it introduces the language from scratch and also covers later topics of the course. It is completely optional and for extra help only.<br>
        <strong>Big Java: Early Objects 7/e</strong><br>

      </p>
      <h2>Outside Sources of Help</h2>
      <p>
        There are additional outside of the class opportunity if you prefer 1-1 tutoring: The Learning Center is an excellent resource for CSSE220 students. Tutor schedules for Learning Center tutoring can be found <a href="https://rosehulman.sharepoint.com/sites/LC/SitePages/Learning-Center-Tutor.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>. Additionally, Sophomore Residence (Percopo Hall) has tutors available.

    <!-- Section 4: Help Citation -->
    <button class="collapsible">Help Citation</button>
    <div class="content-section">
      <p>
        In your homework assignments you should add a “Help Citation”:
      </p>
      <pre>
***************************************************************************************
*         REQUIRED HELP CITATION
* 
*         TODO: cite your help here or say "only used CSSE220 materials"
***************************************************************************************
      </pre>
      <p>
        If you create a new file, add your own Help Citation. Failure to include a Help Citation (even if it simply states that you “only used CSSE220 materials”) may result in losing points. You MUST list anyone who helps you (instructors, TAs, peers, etc.) or any materials outside the CSSE220 provided material and Oracle documentation.

        <li>Two Exams</li>
        <li>Final project</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each assignment or exam has an associated point value and rubric. The overall letter grade is determined by the weighted average of the following categories:
      </p>
      <pre>
Category                                Weight (%)
------------------------------------------------------
Programming Homework                    15%
Non-Programming Homework                15%
In-class Worksheets/Quizzes             10%
In-class Labs                           15%
Final Project                           20%
2 Exams                                 20%
Attendance                               5%

      </pre>
      <h2>Final Project Average</h2>
      <p>
        The Final Project is critical. You must have at least a 'D' average for the overall project grade to pass the course. An 'F' average on the project (< 60%) results in an F for the course.
      </p>
      <h2>Exam Grading Averages</h2>
      <p>
        Each exam is out of 100 points. Important rules include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You must earn at least one exam score ≥ 70% to be eligible for a course grade of C or higher</li>
        <li>You must have at least a 'D' average over all exams to pass</li>
        <li>An 'F' average over the exams (< 60%) results in an F for the course</li>
        <li>You must demonstrate that you can individually write and debug Java programs at the course level</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Attendance Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Participation and attendance are required. If you exceed eight absences you may not be allowed to take an exam without a proper documentation (e.g., ilness) and per Institional policy, 
        exceeding eight absencees may result in failure. </p>
        <p>Note that you must earn a C or better in CSSE220 to progress to CSSE230.
      </p>
      <p>Attendance is taken during the class. If you forget to mark your attendance, please contact the professor immediately.</p>

Your solutions and explanations are individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Sharing Exam code is strictly prohibited and it is against Rose-Hulman code of honors.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Classroom Conduct</h2>
      <p>
        To ensure a welcoming and professional classroom climate, please:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Speak to everyone with courtesy and professionalism</li>
        <li>Do not interupt the lecture. If you have a question, raise your hand, or wait until Discussion. Do not talk loud during In-Class Lab</li>
        <li>Do not use Phone during the class. Please step out if you need to but promptly return.</li>
        <li>If you are done with In-Class Work, you can leave early or you can start working on homework. Do not work on external assignments while in class</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you experience issues that hinder your ability to be respectful or focused, please contact your instructor or the Student Counseling Center.
